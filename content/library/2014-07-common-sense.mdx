summary: >
  Thomas Paine's *Common Sense* is a powerful political pamphlet that argued for
  American independence at a time when many colonists still hoped for
  reconciliation with Britain. Paine challenged monarchy as an outdated and
  unjust system, exposed the irrationality of hereditary rule, and made a clear,
  emotionally compelling case for self-government. His writing was direct,
  accessible, and intentionally unpretentious—designed to stir ordinary people,
  not just political elites. The pamphlet became one of the most influential
  works in American political history, helping shift public opinion toward the
  idea that independence was both necessary and inevitable.

  - "A long habit of not thinking a thing wrong gives it a superficial appearance of being right."
  - "We have it in our power to begin the world over again."
