summary: >
  Richard Cantillon’s *Essay on the Nature of Trade in General* is one of the
  earliest systematic works in economics. Cantillon explains how prices emerge
  from land, labor, and entrepreneurship; how money circulates through an
  economy; and how markets adjust through incentives rather than government
  direction. His insights laid the groundwork for later classical economists,
  especially on value, risk-taking, and the role of the entrepreneur.
quotes:
  - "The market price of things depends on their abundance or scarcity relative to demand."
  - "Entrepreneurs fix prices based on risk and uncertainty, not certainty."
  - "Money is the measure by which we compare the value of all commodities."
