summary: >
  Jonathan Wolff’s *An Introduction to Political Philosophy* offers a clear and
  accessible overview of central political questions—authority, liberty, justice,
  equality, democracy, and the state. Wolff explains major thinkers and
  historical debates without jargon, helping readers understand how political
  institutions justify themselves and what philosophical arguments lie behind
  everyday political claims.
quotes:
  - "Political philosophy asks not only how we live, but how we should live together."
  - "To justify the state is to explain why people should accept its authority."
  - "Freedom is not merely the absence of constraint, but the condition in which we can pursue our goals."
