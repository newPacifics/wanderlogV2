summary: A profound treatise on architecture, design, and the nature of quality. Alexander argues that the best way to build is not through rigid planning, but through a "pattern language" that emerges from the life within the structure.
quotes:
  - There is a central quality which is the root criterion of life and spirit in a man, a town, a building, or a wilderness. This quality is objective and precise, but it cannot be named.
  - To be wild is not to be crazy or psychotic. It is to be natural.
