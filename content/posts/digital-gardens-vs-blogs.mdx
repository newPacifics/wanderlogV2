description: Why I prefer the metaphor of a garden over a stream of consciousness.

A blog is a river: chronologically sorting ideas that float by, never to return. A digital garden is a landscape: ideas are planted, they grow, they are pruned, and sometimes they die.

### The Problem with Time

Chronology is a poor sorting mechanism for knowledge. The fact that I wrote something in 2018 doesn't mean it's less relevant than what I wrote today. In fact, if the idea was foundational, it might be *more* relevant.

Digital gardens break the tyranny of the timestamp. They use **topology** instead of **chronology**. Concepts are linked by relevance, forming a graph of thought rather than a timeline of production.
